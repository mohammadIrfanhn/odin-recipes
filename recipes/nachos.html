    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These chicken nachos are easy to prepare, delicious, and sure to be a big hit! Hearty enough for a meal. The key flavors are in the chicken topping which also makes a great filling for tacos and quesadillas. I recommend serving with sour cream and guacamole but you can be as creative as you like!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>6 green onions, sliced, white parts and tops separated</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 shredded, cooked, whole chicken breast</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup salsa</li>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) package tortilla chips</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar/Monterey Jack cheese blend</li>
        <li>½ large tomato, diced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

    </ol>
